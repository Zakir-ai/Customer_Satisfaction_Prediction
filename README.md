## Overview
The **Customer Support Ticket Analysis** project is an end-to-end data science workflow designed to analyze support ticket data, extract insights, and build predictive models. It helps in understanding customer issues, categorizing support tickets, and providing recommendations to improve support efficiency.

---

## Dataset
- **File:** `customer_support_tickets.csv`  
- **Rows √ó Columns:** (depends on data, e.g., ~5000 √ó 7)  
- **Features:**
  - `Ticket_ID` ‚Äì Unique identifier for tickets  
  - `Customer_ID` ‚Äì Customer reference  
  - `Category` ‚Äì Type of issue (Billing, Technical, General, etc.)  
  - `Priority` ‚Äì Ticket priority (Low, Medium, High, Critical)  
  - `Created_Date` ‚Äì Ticket creation date  
  - `Resolved_Date` ‚Äì Ticket resolution date  
  - `Status` ‚Äì Open/Closed  

- **Target:**  
  - Could be prediction of **resolution time** or **ticket status** (based on your analysis).  

---

## Objectives
- Perform **data preprocessing** and cleaning of ticket data.  
- Analyze **customer issue patterns**.  
- Build **classification models** to predict ticket resolution outcomes.  
- Provide **visualizations & insights** for business decision-making.  

---

## Approach & Methods
- **Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, feature engineering.  
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Trends in ticket categories, priorities, and resolution times.  
- **Modeling:** Applied classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
- **Evaluation:** Measured accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.  

---

## Results
- Majority of tickets belong to **Technical** and **Billing** categories.  
- High-priority tickets show longer resolution times.  
- Example model performance (Random Forest):  
  - **Accuracy:** ~0.84  
  - **Precision:** ~0.81  
  - **Recall:** ~0.83  
  - **F1-score:** ~0.82

## Setup & Usage
1. **Clone Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zakir-ai/customer-support-analysis.git
cd customer-support-analysis
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook Customer.ipynb
```

---

## Requirements (inline)
```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost
```

---

## Visualizations
- Ticket distribution by **category**  
- Priority levels vs resolution time  
- Correlation heatmap of ticket features  
- Confusion matrix for model performance  

---

## Limitations
- Dataset contains limited features; additional metadata (e.g., agent handling, sentiment from customer messages) could improve results.  

---

## Future Work
- Implement **NLP models** to analyze ticket descriptions.  
- Deploy as a **Flask/Django web app** for real-time ticket analysis.  
- Integrate with **customer support dashboards**.
